## Alphabet Soup Charity Model Analysis

This project aims to create and evaluate machine learning models to assist Alphabet Soup Charity in making informed decisions regarding funding applications.

### Files Included:

1. `AlphabetSoupCharity.h5` - A trained machine learning model.
2. `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5` - An optimized version of the trained machine learning model.
3. `google_colab.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook detailing the data preprocessing steps and the process of compiling, training, and evaluating a machine learning model.
4. `Optimized.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook outlining the same steps as `google_colab.ipynb` but with potential optimizations or variations.

## File Descriptions:

### 1. H5 Files:

- **`AlphabetSoupCharity.h5`**: Contains a machine learning model trained on the given dataset.
- **`AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5`**: Contains an optimized or alternative version of the machine learning model.

### 2. Jupyter Notebooks:

- **`google_colab.ipynb`**: 
  - **Preprocessing**: Details the steps involved in preparing the data for machine learning.
  - **Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model**: Describes the model's architecture, training process, and performance evaluation.
  
- **`Optimized.ipynb`**: Similar to `google_colab.ipynb` but may include variations or optimizations in the model or preprocessing steps.

## How to Use:

1. **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - Open either `google_colab.ipynb` or `Optimized.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
   - Ensure all dependencies, especially required Python packages, are installed.
   - Run the cells in sequence to understand the model's creation and evaluation process.

2. **H5 Models**:
   - These files can be loaded using libraries such as TensorFlow or Keras to make predictions or further evaluate and optimize.

## Notes:

- Ensure that all files are in the same directory if directly referencing within the notebooks.
- The models in the H5 files correspond to the processes detailed in the Jupyter notebooks. Depending on the notebook, the models might have different architectures or training parameters.
